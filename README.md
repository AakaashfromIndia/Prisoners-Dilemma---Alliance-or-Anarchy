# Prisoner's Dilemma - Alliance or Anarchy
The Prisoner’s Dilemma is one of the most well-known models in game theory, used to explore the complex relationship between cooperation and competition in strategic decision-making. It presents a scenario where two individuals must independently decide whether to cooperate or betray one another, with the resulting payoffs determined by the combination of their choices. 

The scenario begins at a point where both individuals are arrested and interrogated separately for a crime they are suspected of committing together. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence for a conviction unless at least one prisoner confesses. Each prisoner is offered the same deal: if one confesses (defects) while the other remains silent (cooperates), the confessor goes free while the silent accomplice receives a 20 year sentence. If both confess, they each serve five years. However, if both remain silent, they are each sentenced to just one year in prison on a lesser charge as there is no conclusive evidence against them.

From a purely rational standpoint, each prisoner is incentivized to confess. If the other remains silent, confessing leads to immediate freedom rather than a year in prison. If the other confesses, then confessing avoids the harsh 20 year sentence, resulting in only five years instead. Thus, no matter what the other prisoner does, the dominant strategy is to defect. Yet, when both prisoners make this rational choice, the outcome is collectively worse - both serve five years instead of just one if they choose to remain silent. But this optimal solution requires immense trust that the other person would also stay silent, as a betrayal would result in 20 years of imprisonment.

This paradox highlights a central tension between individual rationality and collective welfare. Although mutual cooperation leads to a better joint outcome, the fear of betrayal and the pursuit of self-interest drive both parties toward a suboptimal solution

This classic setup has been reimagined in many forms - from game shows like Split or Steal or Deal or No deal, where contestants choose between sharing or stealing a cash prize, to business rivalries deciding whether to compete or collude, arms races between nations - with each variation revealing how the tension between individual gain and mutual benefit plays out across different contexts.

While the one shot Prisoner’s Dilemma captures the conflict between individual rationality and collective benefit in a single interaction, real world relationships often involve repeated encounters. This leads to a more complex and realistic extension: the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD). In contrast to the one shot Prisoner’s Dilemma, where players interact only once, IPD involves repeated interactions between the same two players over multiple rounds. This repetition introduces a crucial new dimension: the opportunity for players to respond to each other's past behavior. Each decision is no longer made in isolation but becomes part of an ongoing relationship in which past actions can influence future outcomes

The IPD reflects more realistic social and economic situations, where individuals or groups encounter each other repeatedly and must weigh short term incentives against long term consequences. In this context, the incentives to defect remain, but the possibility of future retaliation or reward can encourage cooperation. Players may choose to cooperate not just for immediate gain, but to maintain a mutually beneficial dynamic over time.

This extended interaction allows patterns to emerge and reputations to form, creating a framework where trust and cooperation can be built gradually. Unlike the static nature of the single round game, the iterated version opens the door to dynamic decision making and evolving behavior based on previous outcomes.

The IPD has become a central model for understanding how cooperation can develop and persist, even in situations where self interest dominates. Its implications reach far beyond theoretical scenarios, providing a powerful lens for examining conflict resolution, alliance formation, and social behavior across a range of disciplines – ranging from economics, politics, and social interactions where there is a conflict between balancing personal gain against collective well being of all entities involved

Recognizing the significance of strategic behavior in repeated interactions, professor Robert Axelrod from the University of Michigan had conducted a seminal experiment in the 1980s to identify the most effective strategy for the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma, for which Axelrod invited researchers from various disciplines to submit algorithmic strategies, which were then tested in a computerized round-robin tournament where each strategy played against every other multiple times. The winning strategy turned out to be a rather simple one named ‘Tit for Tat’ which began with cooperation and then copied the opponent's previous move. This strategy outperformed more complex alternatives, demonstrating that cooperation, when paired with reciprocity, could be a highly successful long term tactic.

To further explore the dynamics of strategic adaptation, Axelrod organized a second tournament in which the results of the first were made publicly available. Participants were now able to design their strategies with knowledge of the prior outcomes, often attempting to anticipate and exploit successful patterns. Despite the heightened level of strategic sophistication, Tit for Tat once again emerged as one of the top performing strategies. This outcome reinforced the robustness of reciprocal cooperation and underscored the resilience of trust-based strategies, even in competitive environments where strategic manipulation is anticipated. However, as time progressed, strategies that outperformed Tit for Tat emerged, revealing the limitations of its simplicity and highlighting the dynamic nature of strategic interactions in competitive environments

This set of codes aims to investigate strategic performance in the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma as a game called ‘Alliance or Anarchy: The Choices that Define us’ between a variety of common strategies. These include cooperative strategies (such as Tit for Tat and Generous Tit for Tat), defect-heavy strategies (such as Always Defect and Grim Trigger), and more complex adaptive strategies (such as Pavlov and Echo)
